Follow our standard operating procedure. 

1. First reiterate your understanding of the task and identify the relevant files which needs to be modified / created

2. Break the problem into steps

3. Ask for the current code for the file if you need (no guessing please, better safe than sorry), i will provide you

4. then step by step, give me the complete updated codes for the file (not partial)

5. Don't change variable names randomly and keep consistency

6. When adding new functionality, please ensure you dont break or remove any existing logics and functionality

7. At start of file, add full file path (e.g, // lib/features/student/widgets/student_assignments_list.dart) and detailed 5-6 line description 

8. Always give complete code, and give a summary of # Lines removed and # lines added. This will also help you ensure you dont accidentally delete existing functionality while adding new ones

9. Go step by step. and the end of each step after code also specify what will be the next step
